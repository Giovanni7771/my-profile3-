        <p>A man was running a race but he was in last place this was a 7 mile race. Everyone was running at full speed but the man was running slower but he was giving up.Until he rememberd how much training he did.So the man kept trying but the first place person was half a mile in front of him but the man got up to second place when he ran as fast as he could because he was saving his enerhy.So the first place person was really tired so in the end the man won the race. Moral to the story Dont give up.</p></div>
